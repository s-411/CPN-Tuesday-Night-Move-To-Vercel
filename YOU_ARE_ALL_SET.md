- ✅ Add/edit/delete data
- ✅ View dashboard
- ✅ All premium features (after upgrade)
- ✅ Email confirmations

## 🎓 Testing Premium Features

**The Problem:**
- Stripe checkout doesn't work locally
- You can't upgrade accounts normally

**The Solution:**
```bash
npm run upgrade your-email@example.com
```

This:
1. Finds your user in local database
2. Sets subscription to "active"
3. Sets tier to "premium"
4. Gives you full access

**Then:**
- Refresh browser
- All premium features unlocked
- Test everything locally!

---

## 🔄 Reset Everything

To start fresh:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This will:
- Delete all users
- Delete all data
- Reset to initial state

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"User not found" when upgrading:**
```bash
# Make sure you created the account first
# List all users:
docker exec supabase_db_CPN-Live psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT email FROM auth.users;"
```

**Blank page:**
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

**Database not running:**
```bash
npm run db:status    # Check status
npm run db:start     # Start it
```

**Premium not working after upgrade:**
```bash
# Logout and login again
# Or hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R
```
