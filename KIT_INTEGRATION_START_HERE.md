## 🚦 Before You Test

You mentioned you're going to collect the Kit Form ID. Here's what you need:

### 1. **Get Kit Form ID** (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://app.kit.com
2. Navigate to **Forms**
3. Select the form you want to use for signups
4. Copy the form ID from the URL
   - URL will look like: `https://app.kit.com/forms/123456`
   - Form ID is: `123456`

### 2. **Update `.env.local`** (1 minute)

Open `.env.local` and replace this line:

```bash
KIT_FORM_ID=8220547
```

With your actual form ID:

```bash
KIT_FORM_ID=123456
```

Your Kit API key is already set:
```bash
KIT_API_KEY=kit_b4a8dc959884b5317eb2b7244bdd5f54
```

### 3. **Start Docker** (Required!)

The integration needs Supabase running, which requires Docker:

```bash
# Start Docker Desktop (if not running)
# Then start Supabase:
supabase start
```

This will take a minute or two to spin up all services.

### 4. **Apply Database Migration**

```bash
supabase db reset
```

This adds the `kit_subscriber_id` field to your users table.

---

## 🧪 Quick Test (5 minutes)

Once Supabase is running, test that Kit API is working:

```bash
# Get your anon key first:
supabase status

# Then test Kit API (replace YOUR_ANON_KEY with actual key):
curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/test-kit-api \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

**Expected result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Kit API test completed successfully",
  ...
}
```

Then check your Kit dashboard - you should see a test subscriber with timestamp email.

✅ **If this works, you're good to go!**

## 🎯 What This Integration Does

1. **User signs up** → Added to Kit with "signed-up" tag
2. **User subscribes** → Tagged as "player-mode" in Kit
3. **User cancels** → Tagged as "cancelled" in Kit

**Abandoned Cart:**
- Kit automation waits 10 minutes after signup
- If user doesn't have "player-mode" tag → Send email
- If user does have "player-mode" tag → Skip (already subscribed)

## 🔧 Files Changed

### New Files Created
- `supabase/functions/_shared/kit-api.ts` - Kit API client
- `supabase/functions/test-kit-api/index.ts` - API test
- `supabase/functions/kit-user-signup-manual/index.ts` - Signup sync
- Database migration for `kit_subscriber_id` field
- 4 documentation files in `docs/`

### Files Modified
- `.env.local` - Added Kit configuration
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Calls Kit on signup
- `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts` - Tags users on subscribe/cancel
- `src/lib/types/database.ts` - Added kit_subscriber_id type

---

## ⚡ Key Design Decisions

1. **No scheduled jobs needed** - Kit handles the 10-minute wait internally
2. **No downgrade tracking** - Only track full cancellations (simpler)
3. **Non-blocking** - App works even if Kit API is down
4. **Client-side signup sync** - More reliable for local testing

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Docker not running"
**Solution:** Start Docker Desktop, then `supabase start`

### "KIT_API_KEY not set"
**Solution:** Check `.env.local`, then restart Supabase

### "Subscriber not found"
**Solution:** User wasn't added to Kit during signup - check signup flow first

---

## 📈 Success Criteria

Integration is working when:

✅ New signups appear in Kit with "signed-up" tag
✅ Subscriptions add "player-mode" tag
✅ Cancellations add "cancelled" tag
✅ Database has `kit_subscriber_id` for synced users

---

## 🚀 Ready to Test?

1. Get Kit Form ID (above)
2. Update `.env.local`
3. Start Docker + Supabase
4. Run quick test (above)
5. Follow full testing guide: [KIT_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md](docs/KIT_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md)

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use Gmail +aliases for testing: `youremail+test1@gmail.com`
- Test cards: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Stripe test mode)
- Check Edge Function logs: `supabase functions logs stripe-webhook --tail`
- Monitor Kit dashboard in real-time while testing

---

## ✅ Production Checklist (Later)

Before deploying:
- [ ] Test locally (all flows working)
- [ ] Set Kit API key in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Set Kit API key in Supabase Dashboard (Edge Functions → Secrets)
- [ ] Set Kit Form ID in both
- [ ] Configure Stripe production webhook
- [ ] Create Kit automation for abandoned cart
- [ ] Test with real email address
