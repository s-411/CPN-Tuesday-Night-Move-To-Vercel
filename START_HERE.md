# 👋 START HERE - Your App is Ready!

## ✅ What's Done

I've migrated your app from Vite to Next.js and pre-configured everything with your credentials from `Variables.txt`.

**All code is complete!** You just need to run a few commands to get started.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Copy & Paste These Commands)

Open Terminal, navigate to this folder, and run:

```bash
# Step 1: Set up environment file
mv env.local.READY .env.local

# Step 2: Update package.json for Next.js
cp package.nextjs.json package.json

# Step 3: Install dependencies
npm install

# Step 4: Open a NEW terminal window and run this (keep it running):
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
# Copy the webhook secret (whsec_xxxxx) it outputs

# Step 5: Add the webhook secret to .env.local
# Open .env.local in your editor and replace:
# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_REPLACE_WITH_OUTPUT_FROM_STRIPE_LISTEN
# with the actual value from step 4

# Step 6: Back in your first terminal, start the app:
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your app should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## ⚠️ One Important Thing

Your `Variables.txt` has these for LIVE mode:
```
STRIPE_PRICE_PLAYER_MODE_WEEKLY=prod_TBQoSJAWTY4fNC
STRIPE_PRICE_PLAYER_MODE_ANNUAL=prod_TBQolqXRhqekfI
```

These are **PRODUCT IDs** (prod_xxx), but you need **PRICE IDs** (price_xxx) for subscriptions.

**When you're ready to go live:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Switch to **LIVE mode** (toggle top right)
3. Click on each product
4. Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)
5. Update `VERCEL_ENV_VARS.txt` with the real price IDs

For now, you're using TEST mode which works perfectly for development!
