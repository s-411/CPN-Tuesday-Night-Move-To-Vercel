# ✅ Your App is Ready to Run!

## 🎯 Everything is Pre-Configured

I've taken all the values from your `Variables.txt` and configured your entire app. All the code changes are complete!

---

## 🚀 Option 1: Automatic Setup (Easiest!)

Just run this one command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions. That's it!

---

## 🚀 Option 2: Manual Setup (If Script Doesn't Work)

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Set up your environment file
mv env.local.READY .env.local

# 2. Update package.json
cp package.nextjs.json package.json

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. In a NEW terminal window (keep it running):
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
# Copy the whsec_xxxxx it outputs

# 5. Edit .env.local and paste the webhook secret
# Replace: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_REPLACE_WITH_OUTPUT_FROM_STRIPE_LISTEN
# With: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx (your actual value)

# 6. Start the app
npm run dev
```

## 🚨 Important Note About LIVE Mode

Your `Variables.txt` has these for Stripe LIVE mode:
```
prod_TBQoSJAWTY4fNC
prod_TBQolqXRhqekfI
```

These are **PRODUCT IDs**, but Stripe subscriptions need **PRICE IDs** (start with `price_`).

**For now:** You're using TEST mode (totally fine for development!)

**When going live:** You'll need to get the actual PRICE IDs from Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Switch to LIVE mode
3. Click each product
4. Copy the Price ID (starts with `price_`)

See `VERCEL_ENV_VARS.txt` for details.

---

## 🌐 Deploy to Vercel (When Ready)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com and import your repo
3. Copy all values from `VERCEL_ENV_VARS.txt` into Vercel's environment variables
4. Deploy!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Missing environment variables"
→ Make sure you renamed `env.local.READY` to `.env.local`

### "Stripe webhook not working"
→ Make sure `stripe listen` is running in a separate terminal
→ Make sure you copied the `whsec_xxxxx` to `.env.local`

### "Can't install dependencies"
→ Make sure you ran: `cp package.nextjs.json package.json`

### Other issues
→ Check `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed troubleshooting
