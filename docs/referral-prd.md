## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### 1.1 Analysis Source

- **IDE-based fresh analysis** of existing project documentation and codebase
- Project files reviewed: README.md, START_HERE.md, WHATS_DONE.md, package.json, existing onboarding flow, Stripe integration

### 1.2 Current Project State

**CPN (Cost Per Nut) v2** is a mobile-first relationship metrics tracking application that helps users calculate and analyze relationship efficiency metrics.

- **Primary Purpose**: Track dating expenses, time spent, and outcomes ("nuts") across multiple profiles, calculating metrics like Cost per Nut, Time per Nut, Cost per Hour, Nuts per Hour, and an overall Efficiency Score.

- **Current Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React 18.3, TypeScript 5.5, Vite 5.4, Tailwind CSS 3.4
  - Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
  - Payments: Stripe (Checkout, Webhooks, Customer Portal)
  - Charts: Recharts 3.2
  - Icons: Lucide React

- **Current State**: MVP (Phase 1) is fully implemented with:
  - Profile management (unlimited for Player Mode, 1 for Boyfriend Mode)
  - Data entry and real-time calculations
  - Dashboard and analytics with visualizations
  - Stripe subscription tiers (Boyfriend Mode: Free, Player Mode: $1.99/week or $27/year)
  - Leaderboards with private groups and invite tokens
  - Share features and data export

- **Recent Migration**: Recently migrated from Vite to Next.js for Stripe API routes; environment variables and Supabase client have been updated

### 1.3 Available Documentation

**Documentation Status:**
- ‚úÖ Tech Stack Documentation (package.json, setup guides)
- ‚úÖ Source Tree/Architecture (inferred from file structure and README)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coding Standards (Partial - TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind design system documented)
- ‚úÖ API Documentation (Stripe API routes documented)
- ‚úÖ External API Documentation (Supabase and Stripe integration documented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UX/UI Guidelines (Partial - Design system documented in README)
- ‚úÖ Technical Debt Documentation (Migration guides and troubleshooting docs available)

**Assessment**: Documentation is sufficient for this enhancement. The codebase is well-documented with migration guides and setup instructions. No additional documentation tasks needed.

### 1.4 Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ‚úÖ **Integration with New Systems** (GrowSurf referral platform)
- ‚úÖ **New Feature Addition** (Referral program functionality)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moderate-to-Significant Impact** (New UI surfaces, cross-domain tracking, Stripe credit system integration)

**Enhancement Description:**

Add a "Give 1 Week / Get 1 Week" referral program powered by GrowSurf. Users will receive a unique referral link upon signup, and when friends sign up using that link, the friend gets their first week free and the referrer earns a 1-week credit after the friend's first successful payment. This requires:
- Cross-domain referral tracking (cost-per-nut.com ‚Üí app.cost-per-nut.com)
- Prominent in-app UI surfaces (Refer & Earn page)
- Onboarding nudges
- Integration with Stripe's credit system
- Simplified affiliate onboarding flow (3 steps vs standard 4 steps)
- Tier selection at Stripe checkout (Weekly or Annual with 7-day trial)

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Moderate-to-Significant Impact**
  - New GrowSurf SDK integration (client-side tracking)
  - New Stripe trial period configuration
  - New UI surfaces (landing page banner, Refer & Earn page, affiliate onboarding, modals)
  - Cross-domain cookie/session handling for referral attribution
  - Webhook enhancements for credit issuance after first payment
  - Modified checkout flow with tier selection for referred users
  - New database schema extensions

### 1.5 Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Auto-generate and display a unique referral link for every user immediately upon signup
- Apply "Give 1 / Get 1" incentive: friend's first week is free ($0 at checkout with card required), referrer earns 1-week credit after friend's first payment
- Preserve referral context seamlessly across domains (landing page ‚Üí app signup/checkout)
- Provide a prominent, easy-to-use Refer & Earn page with copy/share actions and simple stats
- Allow referred users to choose between Player Mode Weekly or Annual at checkout (both with 7-day trial)
- Nudge users to share their link during onboarding (post-signup or post-payment)
- Track basic program analytics (clicks, conversions, credits issued) for loop validation
- (Phase II/III) Integrate referral mechanics into leaderboard invite links for viral acceleration

**Background Context:**

CPN currently has a subscription-based revenue model with Boyfriend Mode (Free), Player Mode Weekly ($1.99/week), and Player Mode Annual ($27/year) tiers. The app is experiencing steady growth, but user acquisition is primarily organic with limited viral loops.

The product team identified that users are naturally inclined to share their results and discuss dating efficiency with friends, but there's no formal mechanism to incentivize and track referrals. The existing leaderboard feature shows strong social sharing behavior, making it an ideal future integration point.

This referral program will leverage existing user behavior by providing a clear, simple incentive structure. The "Give 1 / Get 1" model is low-friction (no cash payouts, just subscription credits), aligns with the product's value proposition (helping users save money on dating), and fits naturally into the existing Stripe subscription infrastructure.

The program is designed to be MVP-first (Phase I) with future phases adding leaderboard integration and potentially email automation.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall integrate GrowSurf SDK on the landing page to capture referral attribution via URL parameters (e.g., `?ref=XXXXX`) and persist attribution across domains using cookies/session storage.

**FR2**: The landing page shall display a conditional referral banner ("You were invited to CPN ‚Äî get 1 week free when you join today.") when referral attribution is detected.

**FR3**: The signup modal shall display a conditional "1 week free" banner when referral context is present in the session.

**FR4**: Upon successful signup, referred users shall be immediately redirected to Stripe checkout (bypassing standard onboarding Steps 1-4).

**FR5**: The Stripe checkout API route shall support trial periods (7 days, card required, $0 charge on day 1, first charge on day 8).

**FR6**: The Stripe checkout page shall present both subscription options to referred users:
- Player Mode Weekly: $1.99/week (after trial)
- Player Mode Annual: $27/year (after trial, Save 74%)

**FR7**: The Stripe checkout page shall clearly display "First 7 days free" and "First charge: [date]" for referred users.

**FR8**: Post-checkout, referred users shall be redirected to a simplified 3-step affiliate onboarding flow (Add Girl ‚Üí Add Data ‚Üí See Results), skipping the standard Step 4 (tier selection).

**FR9**: After completing affiliate onboarding Step 3, users shall see a "Enter the App" CTA that provisions them as Player Mode subscribers (Weekly or Annual based on checkout choice) and lands them in the main app.

**FR10**: Every user shall automatically receive a unique GrowSurf referral link upon account creation, accessible via a new "Refer & Earn" page in the app.

**FR11**: The "Refer & Earn" page shall display:
- User's personal referral link
- Copy button
- Share buttons (SMS, WhatsApp, X, TikTok)
- Simple stats: clicks, paid referrals, free weeks earned, free weeks remaining
- "How it works" explainer with program rules

**FR12**: The system shall display a one-time onboarding nudge (modal/toast) post-payment encouraging users to share their referral link ("Invite friends‚Äîyou both get 1 week free").

**FR13**: The Stripe webhook handler shall detect when a referee completes their **first successful payment** (day 7 after trial ends) and trigger a reward issuance to the referrer.

**FR14**: Upon referee's first payment, the system shall issue a 1-week subscription credit to the referrer via Stripe (coupon or subscription credit).

**FR15**: The system shall block self-referrals by detecting matching email addresses or payment methods between referrer and referee.

**FR16**: An admin analytics dashboard shall display referral pairs (referrer ‚Üí referee), reward status (pending, issued, voided), and program metrics (total referrals, conversion rate, credits issued).

**FR17** (Phase II/III): Leaderboard invite links shall include referral attribution (`/join/:leaderboardToken?ref=:growSurfCode`), and the join page shall display a referral banner with dual CTAs ("Join Leaderboard" vs "Join with 1 Week Free").

**FR18** (Phase II/III): Users who join via enhanced leaderboard invite + referral flow shall be automatically added to the leaderboard after completing affiliate onboarding.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The referral attribution system shall maintain 99.5% accuracy across domains (cost-per-nut.com ‚Üí app.cost-per-nut.com) on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

**NFR2**: The GrowSurf SDK integration shall not increase landing page load time by more than 200ms (measured via Lighthouse).

**NFR3**: The Stripe checkout API route shall respond within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

**NFR8**: The system shall log all referral events (link generated, signup via referral, checkout completed, credit issued) for audit and analytics purposes.

**NFR9**: The enhancement shall not break existing authentication, onboarding, or checkout flows for non-referred users.

**NFR10**: The codebase shall maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance and follow existing file organization patterns ([src/pages](src/pages), [src/components](src/components), [src/lib](src/lib)).

### 2.3 Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing API Compatibility** - The modified `/app/api/checkout/route.ts` must remain backward-compatible with existing calls from SubscriptionPage, Step4, UpgradeModal, and PaywallModal components. New `referralContext` and `trialPeriodDays` parameters shall be optional.

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility** - The `users` table must be extended to include GrowSurf-related fields (`growsurf_referral_code`, `referred_by_code`, `referral_credits_earned`, `referral_credits_remaining`) without breaking existing queries or RLS policies.

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency** - All new UI surfaces (landing page, affiliate onboarding, Refer & Earn page, referral banners) shall adhere to the existing CPN design system: cpn-yellow (#f2f661), cpn-dark (#1f1f1f), cpn-dark2 (#2a2a2a), National2Condensed headings, ESKlarheit body text, and pill-shaped buttons (100px border-radius).

**CR4: Integration Compatibility** - The GrowSurf SDK integration shall not conflict with existing Supabase Realtime subscriptions, Stripe webhook handlers, or analytics tracking.

---

## 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

### 3.1 Integration with Existing UI

**Design System Adherence:**
All new UI surfaces will strictly follow the existing CPN design system:

- **Colors:**
  - Primary: cpn-yellow (#f2f661) for CTAs, active states, highlights
  - Backgrounds: cpn-dark (#1f1f1f) for main surfaces, cpn-dark2 (#2a2a2a) for cards/modals
  - Text: cpn-white (#ffffff) for primary, cpn-gray (#ababab) for secondary

- **Typography:**
  - Headings: National2Condensed (bold)
  - Body: ESKlarheit

- **Component Patterns:**
  - Buttons: `.btn-cpn` (yellow, pill-shaped, 100px border-radius)
  - Cards: `.card-cpn` (dark, gray border, consistent padding)
  - Inputs: `.input-cpn` (dark, gray border, yellow focus ring)
  - Modals: Existing `Modal.tsx` component with dark overlay

**Component Reuse Strategy:**
- **Signup Modal**: Extend existing [SignUp.tsx](src/pages/SignUp.tsx) with conditional referral banner
- **Onboarding Forms**: Reuse `GirlForm` and `DataEntryForm` from existing Steps 1-2
- **Onboarding Layout**: Reuse [OnboardingLayout.tsx](src/components/OnboardingLayout.tsx) for affiliate flow
- **Share Buttons**: Leverage existing share patterns from ShareCenter and ShareModal

### 3.2 Modified/New Screens and Views

**New Screens:**

1. **Landing Page (`/` or `/home`)**
   - Purpose: Marketing entry point with referral detection
   - Key Elements:
     - Conditional referral banner (when `?ref=` param detected)
     - Hero headline + value proposition
     - Primary CTA: "Get Started" (standard) or "Try for free" (referred users)

5. **Refer & Earn Page (`/refer`)**
   - Heading: "Give 1 Week, Get 1 Week"
   - Referral link display with copy button
   - Share buttons: SMS, WhatsApp, X, TikTok
   - Stats cards: Total Clicks, Paid Referrals, Free Weeks Earned/Remaining
   - "How it works" section with program rules

6. **Enhanced Leaderboard Join Page (`/join/:token?ref=:code`) - Phase II/III**
   - Referral banner + leaderboard preview
   - Dual CTAs: "Join with 1 Week Free" (primary) vs "Join Leaderboard" (secondary)

**Modified Screens:**

1. **Signup Modal (existing [SignUp.tsx](src/pages/SignUp.tsx))**
   - Add conditional banner when referral context detected
   - Post-signup redirect: Checkout (if referred) or Step 1 (if standard)

2. **Sidebar Navigation (existing [App.tsx](src/App.tsx))**
   - Add "Refer & Earn" nav item (Share2 icon)
   - Position: Between "Share" and "Settings"

### 3.3 UI Consistency Requirements

**UC1**: All referral banners use consistent styling:
- Background: `bg-cpn-yellow/10`
- Border: `border border-cpn-yellow/50`
- Text: `text-cpn-yellow` for emphasis
- Padding: `p-4` (mobile), `p-6` (desktop)

---

## 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### 4.1 Existing Technology Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript 5.5 (strict mode), JavaScript/JSX

**Frameworks & Libraries:**
- Frontend: React 18.3, Vite 5.4
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Icons: Lucide React
- Charts: Recharts 3.2

**Database & Backend:**
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- Realtime: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- API Routes: Next.js API routes in `/app/api/`

**External Dependencies:**
- Payments: Stripe (API version 2024-10-28.acacia)
- New: **GrowSurf SDK** (to be added)

**Infrastructure:**
- Hosting: Vercel
- Domains: `cost-per-nut.com` (landing) ‚Üí `app.cost-per-nut.com` (app)

### 4.2 Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:**

Schema Extensions:
```sql
-- Add columns to users table
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS growsurf_referral_code TEXT;
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS referred_by_code TEXT;
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS referral_credits_earned INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS referral_credits_remaining INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS referral_stats JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;

-- Create referral_events table for audit log
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.referral_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  referrer_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  referee_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.referral_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own referral events" ON public.referral_events
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = referrer_user_id OR auth.uid() = referee_user_id
  );
```

**API Integration Strategy:**

GrowSurf Integration:
- Client-side SDK loaded via CDN
- Initialize on landing page load
- Generate referral links on signup via API call
- Track events: signup, first_payment, credit_issued

Stripe API Enhancements:
- Modify [/app/api/checkout/route.ts](app/api/checkout/route.ts) to support `trialPeriodDays` parameter
- Add referral metadata to subscriptions
- Use Stripe balance transactions or coupons for credit issuance

**Frontend Integration Strategy:**

- **Referral Detection**: Utility function `detectReferralContext()` in `/src/lib/referral/utils.ts`
- **State Management**: SessionStorage for referral context persistence
- **Conditional Redirects**: Modify SignUp.tsx onSuccess handler

### 4.3 Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure:**
```
/src
  /pages
    /affiliate
      Step1.tsx
      Step2.tsx
      Step3.tsx
    ReferAndEarn.tsx
    Landing.tsx
  /components
    /referral
      ReferralBanner.tsx
      ReferralLinkDisplay.tsx
      ReferralStatsCards.tsx
  /lib
    /referral
      utils.ts
      growsurf.ts
/app/api
  /checkout
    route.ts (modified)
  /stripe/webhook
    route.ts (enhanced)
  /referral/stats
    route.ts (new)
/supabase/migrations
  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_referral_fields.sql
```

**Coding Standards:**
- TypeScript strict mode required
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind classes only (no inline styles)
- Try/catch with user-facing error messages

### 4.4 Deployment and Operations

**Build Process:** No changes to existing Vite build

**Deployment Strategy:**
1. Deploy database migration
2. Deploy API route changes
3. Deploy frontend changes
4. Enable GrowSurf SDK in production
5. Test end-to-end flow

**Configuration Management:**

New Environment Variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GROWSURF_API_KEY=your_api_key
GROWSURF_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_REFERRAL_TRIAL_DAYS=7
NEXT_PUBLIC_REFERRAL_CREDIT_WEEKS=1
ENABLE_REFERRAL_PROGRAM=true
```

### 4.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**

1. **GrowSurf SDK conflicts** ‚Üí Async loading, staging tests
2. **Safari ITP breaks attribution** ‚Üí GrowSurf uses first-party cookies, extensive Safari testing
3. **Stripe trial misconfiguration** ‚Üí Test mode validation, QA sign-off required
4. **Webhook race conditions** ‚Üí Reuse existing retry patterns, idempotency keys

**Integration Risks:**

1. **Breaks non-referred flow** ‚Üí Feature flag for instant rollback, regression testing
2. **Breaks existing checkout calls** ‚Üí Optional parameters, backward compatibility
3. **RLS policy conflicts** ‚Üí Test migration on staging first

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Pre-deployment: Staging tests, test mode validation
- Post-deployment: Monitoring dashboards, feature flags, detailed logging
- Ongoing: Weekly analytics review

## 5. Epic and Story Structure

### 5.1 Epic Approach

**Single Epic: "Give 1 Week / Get 1 Week" Referral Program**

**Rationale:**

1. **Cohesive Feature**: All components work together to deliver one user-facing feature
2. **Shared Technical Foundation**: GrowSurf SDK, referral context, schema changes are foundational
3. **Brownfield Best Practice**: Single epic with sequenced stories minimizes disruption
4. **Clear Phase Boundaries**: Phase I vs Phase II/III captured in story prioritization
5. **Team Coordination**: Unified progress tracking and clear "definition of done"

---

## 6. Epic Details

### Epic 1: "Give 1 Week / Get 1 Week" Referral Program

**Epic Goal:** Enable CPN users to invite friends via unique referral links, automatically applying a 7-day free trial to new signups and issuing 1-week subscription credits to referrers after the friend's first successful payment.

**Integration Requirements:** This epic enhances existing authentication, onboarding, checkout, and subscription management without breaking current functionality for non-referred users.
