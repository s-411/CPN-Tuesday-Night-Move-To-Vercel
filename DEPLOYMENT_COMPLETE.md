```bash
curl https://mgcmkwrtjpkxmjjixyiy.supabase.co/functions/v1/test-kit-api \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1nY21rd3J0anBreG1qaml4eWl5Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4Mjk3NDEsImV4cCI6MjA3NTQwNTc0MX0.RxpnM8n62eEzACbBcF9qIDx3Wq35nSKUkZJFkd5wTUs"
```

**Expected:** `{ "success": true, ... }`

Check your Kit dashboard - you should see a test subscriber!

### Test 2: Real User Flow

1. **Create account** on your live app
   - User should appear in Kit with "signed-up" tag
